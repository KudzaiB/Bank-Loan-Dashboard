**About the Project**

I developed an interactive Bank Loan Dashboard to analyse loan payments, interest rates and borrower trends using data visualisation techniques. The dashboard provides key insights into loan distribution based on employment length, homeownership status, purpose and geographic regions.

**Here is the main dashboard. It provides an overview of the loan data, including total payments, interest rates, and installment counts. The interactive filters allow users to refine insights based on term length, verification status, and loan status**.

**âœ…Key Features:**

ðŸŽ¯Loan Distribution by Employment Length: Displays total loan amounts and term counts across various employment durations.

ðŸŽ¯Loan Purpose Analysis: Highlights the major reasons for loan applications, such as debt consolidation, credit cards and home improvements.

ðŸŽ¯Home Ownership vs. Loan Amounts: Compares loan distribution based on homeownership status such as mortgage, rent and owning.

ðŸŽ¯State wise Loan Payments: Identifies states with the highest loan payments, with California leading.

ðŸŽ¯Loan Terms Comparison: Shows the proportion of loans based on 36 month vs 60 month repayment periods.

ðŸŽ¯Key Metrics Display: Includes total loan payments (436M), distinct payments, interest rates (12.05%), and installment counts.

**âœ…Key Insights:**

ðŸŽ¯Loan distribution is highest among individuals with 10+ years of employment whilst borrowers with less than 1 year of employment receive significantly lower loan amounts. This shows that  employment length helps lenders assess borrower stability. Longer employment history often translates to higher loan approvals, as seen in the trend where individuals with over 10 years of employment receive the most loan amounts

ðŸŽ¯Top Loan Purposes was Debt consolidation (254M), Credit card refinancing (65M) and Home improvement (36M). This highlights the financial behavior of borrowers who are using loans to manage previous debts.

ðŸŽ¯Mortgage holders receive the highest loan amounts (219M). Mortgage holders tend to receive higher loan amounts due to their asset backed credibility, while renters and homeowners receive lower amounts. This can be useful for lenders when assessing financial risk.

ðŸŽ¯California (CA) leads with 84M in loan payments, followed by New York (46M) and Texas (34M). This geographical analysis shows that California has the highest loan payments, which could be due to higher living costs or a larger population of borrowers.

ðŸŽ¯There are two loan terms that is the 36 months and 60 months. The majority of loans are long-term (60 months). This could be due to preferring lower monthly payments, while some prefer 36-month loans for faster debt resolution
